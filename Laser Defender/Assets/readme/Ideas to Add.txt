# mobile game based

Convert into 16:9 landscape
adding wide background senarios

add left half screen circle drag movement, for moving the space ship
with animation of thrusters and booster of spaceships while moving

add right half screen circle drag movement like mini-miltia, 
half-drag --> aim in that direction, i.e., rotate ship in that direction
full-drag --> shoot in that direction


# Addional Content

## more waves
Create Asteriod waves, with Can shoot ability = false
using dust_particles.png's to create a particle effect for destruction of these asteroids

## dynamic retro waves
wave path moves top to bottom and bottom to top of the game screen
try to add path in spiral fashion going up and down to make it more artistic...
