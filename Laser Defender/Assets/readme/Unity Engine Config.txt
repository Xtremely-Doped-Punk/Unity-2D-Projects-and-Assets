# Tags and Layers (Inspector):
Projectiles like player laser and enemy laser,
in their Sprite Renderer component, Additional Settings:
Sort Layer: Projectiles(newly created layer that is to be rendered before other default
so that player/enemy appear in top of the bullet they shoot resp.

# Physics2D (Project Settings):
`Player, Enemy, Player-Projectile, Enemy-Projectile`
- these are user added layers to differenciate the properties of 
which collider in which layer will trigger the collision event
Even without these i have made the code efficiently to differenciate 
player damage and enemy damage, just for tutorial purposes...

# Scenes Order (Build Settings):
1. Start Menu
2. Game
3. Game Over
